# Do not import and use main() directly! Using it directly is actively
# discouraged by pip's maintainers. The name, location and behavior of
# this function is subject to change, so calling it directly is not
# portable across different pip versions.

# In addition, running pip in-process is unsupported and unsafe. This is
# elaborated in detail at
# https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#using-pip-from-your-program.
# That document also provides suggestions that should work for nearly
# all users that are considering importing and using main() directly.

# However, we know that certain users will still want to invoke pip
# in-process. If you understand and accept the implications of using pip
# in an unsupported manner, the best approach is to use runpy to avoid
# depending on the exact location of this entry point.

# The following example shows how to use runpy to invoke pip in that
# case:
#
#     sys.argv = ["pip", your, args, here]
#     runpy.run_module("pip", run_name="__main__")
#
# Note that this will exit the process after running, unlike a direct
# call to main. As it is not safe to do any processing after calling
# main, this should not be an issue in practice.
